I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science and Social Data Analytics. Before attending PSU I received a B.A. in Politics with Quantitative Methods from the University of Edinburgh in 2020. My research uses a variety of quantitative techniques to investigate the relationship between metropolitan fragmentation and inequities in public service provision. In my dissertation I examine this topic from three angles, local government spending on public services, satisfaction with services, and the spatial accessibility of services.
